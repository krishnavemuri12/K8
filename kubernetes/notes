Scheduler:

In pod definition yaml file, every pod has field name called "nodeName". By default it is not set.
Scheduler goes through all the pods and looks for those that do not have this property set.
with nodeName you can amanually assign pods to nodes.

in pod.yaml file nodeName will be under spec:
Example:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  nodeName: node01
  containers:
  -  image: nginx
     name: nginx
---

Scheduler runs as a pod in in the kube-system

Labels and Selectors:
in pod definition yaml file under metadata create a section called labels

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: App1
    function: nginx-label
spec:
  nodeName: node01
  containers:
  -  image: nginx
     name: nginx

to select the pod with labels using kubectl
kubectl get pods --selector app=App1

not only pods, Labels and selectors can be specified for all objects

In replicaset yaml labels under the metadata are labels of the replicaset itself
inorder to connect replicaset to the pods we connfigure the selector field under the replica set configuration to match the labels defined on the pod

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
   name: replicaset-1
spec:
   replicas: 2
   selector:   
      matchLabels:
        tier: front-end       ###labels in selector and templates should match 
   template:
     metadata:
       labels:
        tier: nginx           ##labels in selector and templates should match, then only yaml works
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: nginx
         image: nginx
