Scheduler:

In pod definition yaml file, every pod has field name called "nodeName". By default it is not set.
Scheduler goes through all the pods and looks for those that do not have this property set.
with nodeName you can amanually assign pods to nodes.

in pod.yaml file nodeName will be under spec:
Example:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  nodeName: node01
  containers:
  -  image: nginx
     name: nginx
---
