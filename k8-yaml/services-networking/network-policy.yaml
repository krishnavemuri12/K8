# Network policy - restrict the communication between pods.
# they are bounded to namespace.

# Allow and Deny traffic to the pods in the namespace
# Ingress - incoming traffic to the pod - Eg: from other pods, from external, etc
# Egress - outgoing traffic from pod - Eg: to other pods, to external, etc 

#           Ingress                Egress - Ingress on api-server and Egress on Api-server to allow connection to DB
# customer ==========>> Nginx-pod ===========>> api-server ========>> DB

# When setting network policies there are three traffic to consider:
# pod-selector - select the pods to apply the policy (to and from pod)
# namespace-selector - select the namespace to apply the policy (to and from namespace)
# ip-block - select the ip block to apply the policy (to restrict specific IP ranges)
