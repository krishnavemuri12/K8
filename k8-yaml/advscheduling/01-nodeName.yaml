#The `nodeName` field in a Kubernetes Pod specification is used to specify the name of the node where the pod should be scheduled. By setting the `nodeName`, you are instructing Kubernetes to place the pod on a specific node in the cluster.

### Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nodename-pod
spec:
  nodeName: gke-my-first-cluster-node-01 # this is the name of the node where the pod will be scheduled
  containers:
  - name: nodename-container
    image: busybox
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"

#In this example, the pod named `nodename-pod` will be scheduled to run on the node with the name `gke-my-first-cluster-node-01`.
